## Gesture control TurtleSim (ROS2)

This project is a simple example of how to control the TurtleSim using hand gestures. The project uses the *OpenCV library* to capture the video from the webcam and the *mediapipe library *detect the hand gestures. The detected hand gestures are then used to control the TurtleSim.

## Prerequisites
- ROS2
- OpenCV
- mediapipe
